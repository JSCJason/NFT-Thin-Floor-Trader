# Magic Eden Trading üöÄ 

## üß© **How Thin Floor Strategy Benefits me?**  
- **Focus on High-Value Opportunities:** Identify thin floors to maximize profitability.  
- **Save Time:** Automate complex analysis and trading workflows.  
- **Stay Ahead:** Act on real-time data with blazing speed and accuracy.  

## üåü Thin Floor Strategy: 

My goal is to create a programmatic approach to trading NFTs on the **Magic Eden marketplace** with precision and automation. This strategy focuses on identifying collections with **thin floors**‚Äîscarce listings and high demand‚Äîallowing trader's like us to capitalize on profitable opportunities in the fast-paced NFT market on the **Solana blockchain**.

## üéØ **What is Thin Floor Strategy?**

What is the **Thin Floor Strategy** for NFTs?
The **Thin Floor Strategy** focuses on identifying NFT collections with thin floors‚Äîsituations where the number of NFTs listed for sale at the floor price (the lowest price in the collection) is very limited relative to the total supply. These thin floors suggest scarcity, which can create buying pressure and drive up prices when demand increases.

## How Can **Thin Floor Strategy** Be Profitable?
- **Scarcity Drives Value:** Collections with fewer items listed at the floor price can experience rapid price increases when demand rises, creating opportunities to sell at a profit.
- **Volume Signals Demand:** High trading volume is a strong indicator of buyer interest, increasing the likelihood of quick sales and price momentum.
- **Automation Ensures Speed:** In the NFT ecosystem, timing is critical. This strategy leverages automation to analyze the market, identify opportunities, and execute trades faster than manual methods.
- **Scalability and Consistency:** By focusing on multiple collections simultaneously and relying on data-driven decisions, the strategy maximizes the potential for consistent profits across the NFT marketplace.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup and Installation**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Solana wallet with SOL for trading
- (Optional) Custom RPC endpoint for better performance

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thin-floor-strategy.git
   cd thin-floor-strategy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` with your:
   - Solana wallet private key
   - RPC endpoint (optional)
   - Trading parameters

## üöÄ **Usage**

1. Start the trading bot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Monitor the logs in the `logs` directory for trading activity and performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

### Trading Parameters
Adjust these in your `.env` file:
- `MIN_VOLUME_THRESHOLD`: Minimum 7-day trading volume (in SOL)
- `MAX_SCARCITY_RATIO`: Maximum ratio of listed/total items
- `MAX_PRICE_SOL`: Maximum price to pay for an NFT

### Logging
Logs are stored in the `logs` directory with daily rotation.

## üîç **How It Works**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Market Analysis: Scouting the Best Collections**  
- The `NFTVolumeAnalyzer` connects to the Magic Eden API to retrieve:  
  - **7-day trading volume**  
  - **Floor price**  
  - **Listed item count**  

- Collections are filtered using two configurable thresholds:  
  - üìä **Volume Threshold:** Collections with high trading activity are prioritized.  
  - üîí **Floor Listings Threshold:** Collections with a low ratio of listed items to total supply are flagged, indicating scarcity and potential demand spikes.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Filtered Collection Analysis**  
NFT collections that pass the initial filters undergo further analysis to extract key metrics:  
- **Trading Volume** (7-day): Measures collection popularity.  
- **Floor Price (in SOL):** Identifies entry-level cost for NFTs.  
- **Scarcity Ratio:** Highlights collections with constrained supply.  

This process ensures only the **most promising collections** are flagged for trading.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Trade Execution: Acting on Opportunities**  
The `NFTTradingExecutor` automates the trading process:  
1. Fetches **floor listings** of flagged collections from Magic Eden.  
2. Identifies and selects undervalued NFTs based on the **floor price**.  
3. Constructs a secure Solana blockchain transaction using:  
   - Buyer's wallet (`Keypair`)  
   - Seller's address (`mintAddress`)  
   - Purchase price in SOL  

4. Executes the transaction via Magic Eden's smart contract using libraries like `solana-py` and `solders`.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Automation Workflow**  
The strategy is fully automated:  
- **Step 1:** Collections are analyzed for thin floor opportunities.  
- **Step 2:** If conditions are met, trades are executed programmatically.  
- **Step 3:** The bot runs continuously with minimal manual input, saving time and effort.

## üí° **Key Features**

### üîÑ **Fully Automated**  
Programmatic analysis and trading remove the need for manual intervention.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Parameters**  
Adjust thresholds for **volume** and **floor scarcity** to fine-tune the strategy.  

### üìà **Scalable & Efficient**  
Analyze multiple collections simultaneously and execute trades across various opportunities.  

### üîê **Secure Blockchain Transactions**  
All trades interact directly with Magic Eden's smart contract using the **Solana blockchain** for transparency and security.  

### üõ†Ô∏è **Detailed Logging**  
Every action‚Äîfrom analysis to execution‚Äîis logged for tracking and debugging.
